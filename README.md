# Breaking News? [Live demo!](https://repod.github.io/news/)
A totally original take on displaying Reddit post information.

A joint project between [Caaz](https://github.com/Caaz) and [RePod](https://github.com/RePod).

Features:
 - Basic support for direct URLs to various media types
 - Enhanced support for GfyCat URLs
 - URL copy-and-paste ready to link to certain item
 - Auto-playback based on interval
 - Configurable source supporting subreddits, multireddits, searches, random, etc.
   - At some step requires a path to the JSON file

**Coming whenever:**
 - Themes
 - YouTube?
 - A back button
 - Pagination
   - Currently anything other than *random.json* stays on the defined page
   - Most likely with an incremental syntax

Uses Local Storage to track the given source. Configurable by clicking the **Breaking News** button.
